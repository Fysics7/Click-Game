# Geeky Stuff Click Game
Don't Click The Same Image Twice - React App This is my first React App.  The application is a clicking game in which the user can continue to click images, but can't click the same image twice.  If they do, the game is over.  Since, I love video games and science fiction, the images I used vary between the two.  I found the images I wanted to use at www.pexels.com

### Overview
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a React application that required the user to click on various images, but they are not supposed to click the same 
image twice. If they do, the game ends.  If the user continues to click images, their score will increase.  Once they get to 10, they win.
